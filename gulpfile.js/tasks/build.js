  Build task
  ==========
  This is the main Protocol build task which is responsible
  for compiling and building all assets including html, css,
  js, and static media. The build task consists of a number of
  smaller composite tasks, each having a singular responsibility.
  Composite tasks are performed serially when they depend on one
  another. When there is no dependency, they run in parallel to
  help reduce build times.
