# Mozilla Design System

A modular design system for Mozilla websites.

## Quick Start

This pattern library is based on [Drizzle](https://github.com/cloudfour/drizzle/), which is itself based on [Fabricator](https://fbrctr.github.io/). It's essentially a Node-based static site generator, and uses [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) as a task runner for local development.

0. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm start` in the resulting directory.

This will install dependencies, build the site, and start the development server at <http://localhost:3000>.

See the docs for more.
