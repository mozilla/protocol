name: Picto
description: A small block of content featuring a pictographic icon, headline, and body.
order: 1
notes: |
    - Pictos are best suited for a [multi-column layout](/patterns/templates/columns.html) but will otherwise stack in a single column.
    - Without any other constraints, a picto has a maximum width of 688px (equal to the "medium" content width).
    - The image should usually be a small icon (hence "picto") but larger images or even videos can be accommodated in some layouts.
    - Three variants are available:
      - The image on top, aligned with the text (this is the default).
      - The image on top with text and image centered.
      - The image on one side, aligned to the top of the text.
    - The picto variant is determined by a theme class on a container element so the same variant applies to the entire set:
      - The default (image on top, aligned with text) doesn't require a theme class.
      - `mzp-t-picto-center`
      - `mzp-t-picto-side`
    - All parts are optional. For example, you could omit the headline and only use body text, or omit the body and only have a headline. Technically you could omit the image but then you might prefer some other component (is a picto without a picto really a picto?).
tips: |
    - This component should typically appear in groups of at least two. A single picto should be an uncommon exception.
    - All the images in a set of pictos should be the same size so they'll all align neatly.
nonos: |
    - Avoid mismatching the number of picto components to the number of columns, e.g. four pictos in a three-column layout. It won't break, but the fourth one will wrap to another line and leave awkward empty space.
    - Don't combine style variants; centered text with the image on the side doesn't look quite right.
