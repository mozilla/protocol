name: Picto, image on the side
description: A picto component with the image oriented to one side of the content, with a bit of space in between.
order: 2
notes: |
    - In this orientation the image has a maximum width of 64px, so it's best suited for simple icons.
    - The image will be on the left in left-to-right languages, and on the right in right-to-left.
    - The image is vertically aligned to the top of the text.
nonos: |
    - This style works best in wider columns, allowing space for the image and text. Don't use it in a very narrow container, such as a four-column layout.
