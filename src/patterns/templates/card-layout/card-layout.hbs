name: Card Layout
description: |
  A layout class for displaying card components in different arrangements.

  All cards stack vertically on small screens but can adapt to different grid formations on wider screens.

  See [the card layout demo page](/demos/card-layout.html) for a full list of example card layouts and the [card molecule page](/patterns/molecules/card.html) for a list of different card types.
notes: |
  This layout template only sets up the basic grid for each type of layout.
tips: |
  - Use the following CSS classes to indicate the layout type.
    - `mzp-l-card-hero`
    - `mzp-l-card-half`
    - `mzp-l-card-third`
    - `mzp-l-card-quarter`
  - These CSS classes can be applied to any suitable parent element e.g. `<main>`, `<section>`, `<div>`.
  - The grid layout is reversed in right to left (RTL) languages.
