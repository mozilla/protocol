name: Multi-column layout
description: |
    This container class sets up a multi-column layout with two, three, or four columns. It's content-agnostic, but not all Protocol components will work within a multi-column layout.

    Examples: /demos/columns.html
notes: |
    - A theme class sets the number of columns:
      - `mzp-t-columns-two`
      - `mzp-t-columns-three`
      - `mzp-t-columns-four`
    - Columns are evenly sized and evenly spaced. Every column in a group is the same width with the same gutters (space between columns).
    - We don't currently have options for an uneven distribution of columns, such as two columns in one-third/two-thirds proportions. If you need that kind of layout you'll need to use an alternative method.
    - This uses [CSS grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), which is [well supported in modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/css-grid) but not supported in any browsers release prior to 2018. Older browsers will ignore the column layout and content will be linearized by default. If you need a multi-column layout in older browsers you'll need to use an alternative method.
    - The contents of each column should be in its own container element that must be a _direct child_ of the multi-column container, as shown in the example. The kind of element doesn't matter (`div`, `section`, `p`, `img`, etc), it just needs to be a direct child of the container.
    - The `.mzp-l-columns` class doesn't apply a width; without any other constraints the column container will fill the width of its own container, which may be the browser window. Use this in conjunction with a `.mzp-l-content` container, either nested or applying both classes to the same container.
    - A column's width isn't explicit; the width of a column depends on the number of columns and the width of the container (which also varies).
    - Gutters between columns are 64px at most viewport sizes, but expand to 80px in extra large viewports.
    - Column layouts change automatically at different breakpoints, or in different container widths. [See the demo](/demos/columns.html#container-sizes).
        - Small viewports and containers are always a single column.
        - In medium viewports or containers, three columns will be a single column.
        - In medium viewports or containers, four columns will be two columns with the third and fourth wrapping under the first and second.

    - Avoid nesting `.mzp-l-columns` containers. It gets weird.
