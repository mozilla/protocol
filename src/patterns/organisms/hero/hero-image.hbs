name: Hero with image
order: 2
description: |
  A hero section featuring a large image.
notes: |
  - Add the `mzp-has-image` class to change the layout for a hero image. The copy and image stack vertically on small screens and appear side by side on larger screens.
  - By default the copy is on the left and image on the right. Reversed the layout with an `mzp-l-reverse` class.
  - The image and copy switch sides in RTL languages. Plan for this and choose your image wisely.
  - Hero images can overflow their container, with part of one side hidden off-screen at some screen sizes. Plan for this and choose your image wisely.
  - The height of the hero section is determined by the amount of text within it. Long titles, long introductions, product logos, CTAs, etc all contribute to how much space the hero takes up.
  - Images are scaled to fit the height of the container, thus the size of the image is largely determined by the height of the hero section. Taller heroes (with more content) will have larger images and more of one side may be hidden off-screen, depending on the image width. Plan for this and choose your image wisely.
  - Page heroes are intended to span the entire viewport. [See the demo page](/demos/hero.html) for more examples in a full window context.
tips: |
  - We recommend hero images at least 800px by 600px. A 16:9 aspect ratio works well though more of it can be hidden when the hero section is tall. Plan for this and choose your image wisely.
  - Choose your image wisely.
