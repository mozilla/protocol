  Theme the Split by wrapping an element with the class `mzp-c-split-bg` around the inner container.
tips: |
  - Use any of the standard background theme classes: `mzp-t-background-alt`, `mzp-t-dark`, or both together `mzp-t-dark mzp-t-background-alt`, or apply a custom background color in your own CSS.
  - To make the background butt against the content above or below the Split, without additional vertical spacing, add the class `mzp-t-split-nospace`. Note that images can't "pop out" of a Split without that additional space.
