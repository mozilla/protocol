name: Text link
description: |
  Just your standard inline text link with no modifiers. Font family, size, weight, etc are inherited from the parent.
order: 1
notes: |
  Links can appear in a number of states: unvisited, visited, hovered, active, and focused. It’s hard to display these states visually while keeping this component accurate to reality, so we’ve set up [a separate demo page](/demos/link-styles.html) to show all the link states in one place.
tips: |
  - Keep link text short, just a few words.
  - The text in a link should be descriptive of the destination or offer some clear indication of where the link leads.
  - You can use the `light-links` mixin for dark background where links require higher text contrast.
nonos: |
  - Don’t use “click here” as link text.
  - Don‘t use text links (the `a` element) to trigger scripted actions unless the link also has a real destination in case JavaScript isn’t available. The `href` attribute should have a real URL, not `#` or `javascript:void(0)`. For script-only actions use a `button` element. Buttons do things; links go places.
  - Don’t use rel="nofollow" for internal links
