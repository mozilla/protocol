description: |
  This is a primary button. It represents the primary action someone should take when they land on any given page. Primary buttons have a solid background color, and should be reserved for only one action per page.
tips: |
  - This can be a `button` element, an `input type="button"` in a form or a link.
  - Avoid using button styling for ordinary links that simply lead to another page. Buttons should typically trigger some specific action. Buttons do things; links go places.
  - That said, sometimes the action **is** to visit another page. A strong call to action might be a link styled as a button. Use them wisely.
