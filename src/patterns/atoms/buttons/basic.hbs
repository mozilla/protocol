name: Basic button
description: |
  Just a common button, nothing too fancy. This can be a `button` element, an `input type="button"` in a form or a link.
tips: |
  - Avoid using button styling for ordinary links that simply lead to another page. Buttons should typically trigger some specific action. Buttons do things; links go places.
  - That said, sometimes the action **is** to visit another page. A strong call to action might be a link styled as a button. Use them wisely.
