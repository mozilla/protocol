description: |
    A heading acts as a title for the content that immediately follows it. We've declared default sizes for headings in keeping with their standard ranking but this base size can be overridden with more context-specific styling.
nonos: |
    - Avoid breaking rank just for font sizing. The next heading after an `h1` should be an `h2` even if that `h2` is much smaller. Use HTML for meaning and CSS for styling. You can make that `h2` whatever size you need.
    - Avoid "stacking" headings without any body content in between, eg. an `h2` immediately following an `h1`. If you need a subheading or tagline immediately after a title, chances are it should be a paragraph rather than a second heading.
    - There are presentational utility classes available that you can apply to any heading, e.g. `mzp-u-title-sm`, but don't abuse them. Use the equivalent mixins in Sass/SCSS.
