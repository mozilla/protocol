The `<details>` element was introduced in HTML5 to provide a native collapsible “accordion”
widget that previously required JavaScript. However, older browsers don't support the newer
elements, so Protocol includes a JavaScript polyfill to improve backwards compatibility.

The `<details>` element requires a `<summary>`, which you can combine with headings to
convey hierarchy, if appropriate.

Note: though they’re visually similar, this native HTML element is distinct from the Protocol
[Details component](details-component).
