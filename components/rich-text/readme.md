When using Protocol with a CMS there are cases where you will be outputting
content which was entered in a rich text editor. In this case you will
likely want lists, headings, and tables to have some default styling.

Adding the `mzp-u-rich-text` class to the wrapper around the output will
add styles for this components.

This class will also optimize heading spacing to improve readability.
