A type of navigation menu used to provide a list of links based on current page within the site hierarchy, allowing users to visit previous pages from the current page.

### Notes:
- use `<ol>` nested with a `<nav>` to use semantic HTML and structure.
- Use the `.mzp-t-dark` options to use dark mode.
