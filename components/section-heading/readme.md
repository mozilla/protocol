Use section headings to help organize your page content into sections. Section
headings are centered and get more space around them than a plain heading element.

## Theme Classes

### No Space: `mzp-t-section-heading-nospace`

Use this theme class to remove vertical padding from the section heading. This is
useful when you need tighter control over spacing in custom layouts or when the
section heading is adjacent to other components that already provide their own
spacing.
