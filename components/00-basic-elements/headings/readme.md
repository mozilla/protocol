A heading acts as a title for the content that immediately follows it. We’ve
declared default sizes for headings in keeping with their standard ranking but
this base size can be overridden with more context-specific styling.

### No-nos

- Avoid breaking rank just for font sizing. The next heading after an `<h1>`
  should be an `<h2>` even if that `<h2>` is much smaller. Use HTML for meaning
  and CSS for styling. You can make that `<h2>` whatever size you need.
- Avoid "stacking" headings without any body content in between, eg. an `<h2>`
  immediately following an `<h1>`. If you need a subheading or tagline
  immediately after a title, chances are it should be a paragraph rather than
  a second heading.
