**This component is deprecated.** You can use the [Call-out component](/components/detail/call-out)
in place of a centered Hero, or the [Split component](/components/detail/split)
in place of a Hero with image.

A Hero is a large promotional section, usually at the very top of the page, featuring
at minimum a headline. It should usually also include a call to action and either
a tagline or description, occasionally both.

The content is centered by default but can be [paired with an image](/components/detail/hero--with-image).

### No-nos
This component already has an inner container, so donâ€™t place it inside
the `mzp-l-content` [container](/components/detail/content-container). The nested
spacing will get weird.
