**This component is deprecated.** You can use the [Callout component](callout)
in place of a centered Hero, or the [Split component](split) in place of a
Hero with image.

A Hero is a large promotional section, usually at the very top of the page,
featuring at minimum a headline. It should usually also include a call to action
and either a tagline or description, occasionally both.

The content is centered by default but can be [paired with an image](hero--with-image).

### No-nos

This component already has an inner container, so don’t place it inside the
`mzp-l-content` [container](content-container). The nested spacing will get
weird.
