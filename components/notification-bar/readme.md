A notification bar provides contextual feedback messages.

### Tips

- The message should be short, usually a single sentence.
- The bar can include an optional button to dismiss the notification.
- If the message needs to include a prominent action link, you can use the class
  `mzp-c-notification-bar-cta` to make the link stand out.

Notification bars have a few different styles to indicate different types of
messages:

- `mzp-t-success`
- `mzp-t-warning`
- `mzp-t-error`
- `mzp-t-click`
