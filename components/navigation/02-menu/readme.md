An expandable menu used in the [Navigation](navigation) component, consisting of
[Menu Items](menu-item) and an optional Card component.

- On wide viewports a menu's content is displayed when hovering or focusing on
  a menu link.
- On small viewports a menu's content is expanded/collapsed when clicking on a
  menu link.
- Menu content should consist of two lists of one or more [Menu Items](menu-item).
- An [Extra Small Card](card--extra-small) can also be included inside a menu
  using the `mzp-has-card` class. Cards are only visible on wide viewports.
- A menu can also feature regular links that do not expand on hover/click by
  omitting the `mzp-has-drop-down` and `mzp-js-expandable` classes.
- A menu with a state class of `mzp-is-basic` is accessible without JavaScript.
  This state class gets replaced with `mzp-is-enhanced` when JS is executed.

  Object with the following properties.
  - `onMenuOpen` [Function] callback when a menu is opened (optional).
