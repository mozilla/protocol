A billboard style call-out with an image, text and link.

The image and copy stack vertically on small screens, and run full-width
horizontally on larger screens.

### Tips:
- Use the layout classes `mzp-l-billboard-left` or `mzp-l-billboard-right` to
  indicate the layout.
- The layout is **not** reversed in right to left (RTL) languages, since text is
  already centered and images may prefer a particular orientation.
- Image should be `346px` in width and `346px` in height.
- Headlines should be a maximum of 35 characters, and description should be a
  maximum of 100 characters.
