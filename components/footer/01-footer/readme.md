A page footer component, containing common links to complement primary navigation
and flexible structure. It is best viewed with “[full view](/components/preview/footer)”
as it’s meant to take up the full width of the page.

The optional elements are:
- logo
- footer-sections (with links)
- [language selector](language-switcher)
- social media icons.

This demo includes all optional elements and six footer sections (footer sections
will be evenly spaced across component width whatever number you use).

See [Example Basic](example-basic) for a simpler demo.

### Tips

- Add Details Component script and Footer script to collapse footer sections into
  expandable titles on mobile screens.
