A page footer component, containing common links to complement primary navigation and flexible structure. It is best viewed with "full view" as it's meant to take up the full width of the page.

The optional elements are:
- logo
- footer-sections (with links)
- [language selector](/components/detail/language-switcher)
- social media icons.

This demo includes all optional elements and six footer sections (footer sections will be evenly spaced across component width whatever number you use).

See [Example Basic](/components/detail/example-basic) for a simpler demo.

### Tips

- Add Details Component script and Footer script to collapse footer sections into expandable titles on mobile screens.
