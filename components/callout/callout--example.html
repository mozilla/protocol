        <p>This is an example of a more elaborate Callout component like you might see as a page header or other prominent callout. It features a logo and two short paragraphs as a description, one of which is perhaps a little too long. Centered text is hard to read in large blocks so itâ€˜s best to keep it short.</p>
        <p>It also has a video.</p>
