context:
  title: A Headline With 30 Characters
  title_el: h1
  desc: A description of about 150 characters, give or take. Because this text is centered it works best with a tagline or brief intro, just a sentence or two.
  cta: False
  image: False
variants:
  - name: Dark theme
    notes: A dark theme is available with the `mzp-t-dark` theme class. This example omits a description and includes a CTA button.
    context:
      class: mzp-t-dark
      desc: False
      cta: Call to Action
      cta_link: '#'
      cta_class: mzp-t-dark
  - name: Content width
    notes: |
      Adding one of our standard content width classes to the inner container
      (`mzp-l-content`) will apply that width constraint, though the outer
      component still spans the viewport.

      - `mzp-t-content-sm`
      - `mzp-t-content-md`
      - `mzp-t-content-lg`
      - `mzp-t-content-xl`

      This example also has a tertiary background color and an image.
    context:
      class: mzp-t-background-tertiary
      content_class: mzp-t-content-sm
      desc: A description of about 150 characters, give or take. Because this text is centered it works best with a tagline or brief intro, just a sentence or two.
      cta: False

  - name: Compact
    notes: |
      An alternative compact layout can be applied with the `mzp-l-compact`
      class. This is intended for supplemental callouts or promotional blocks.
      A Compact Callout places the content and CTA in two columns, aligned left
      in LTR languages and aligned right for RTL languages. Technically the CTA
      is still optional in a compact layout, but it leaves empty whitespace.

      A Compact Callout spans the full viewport and can result in long line-lengths
      of the text. Itâ€™s often advisable to constrain the width with one of the content
      width classes (this example uses `mzp-t-content-lg`).

      This example also applies a secondary background color and uses a secondary
      product themed CTA button.

      ### Notes
      The previous Compact Call-out used its own class name, `mzp-c-call-out-compact`.
      This is now a variant layout of the Callout component, rather than a separate
      component with its own name. It uses the modifier class `mzp-l-compact`.
    context:
      class: mzp-l-compact mzp-t-background-secondary
      content_class: mzp-t-content-lg
      cta: Call to Action
      cta_class: mzp-t-product mzp-t-secondary
      desc: A description of about 150 characters, give or take. This text is left- or right-aligned but should still be short, only a sentence or two.
