  - name: Disabled
    notes: |
      This is an example of a disabled button. The `disabled` property is added on submit to
      prevent people from submitting their information twice while submitting a form.
      Or it can be removed dynamically when a form is completed, to prevent a user from
      submitting before they've filled out all required fields.
