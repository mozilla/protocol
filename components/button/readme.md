The `mzp-c-button` class can be applied to a `<button>` element, an `<input type="button">` or an `<a>` element. Button size and color themes can be combined as needed.

The primary button is the default style and represents the primary action someone should take to accomplish a task, usually reserved to one primary action on a given page.

### Tips
  - Avoid using button styling for ordinary links that simply lead to another page. Buttons should typically trigger some specific action. Buttons do things; links go places.
  - That said, sometimes the action **is** to visit another page. A strong call to action might be a link styled as a button. Use them wisely.
