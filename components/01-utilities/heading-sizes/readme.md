A heading acts as a title for the content that immediately follows it. We’ve
declared default sizes for headings in keeping with their standard ranking but
this base size can be overridden with more context-specific styling.

There are presentational utility classes available that you can apply to any heading:
- `mzp-u-heading-2xl`
- `mzp-u-heading-xl`
- `mzp-u-heading-lg`
- `mzp-u-heading-md`
- `mzp-u-heading-sm`
- `mzp-u-heading-xs`
- `mzp-u-heading-2xs`
- `mzp-u-heading-3xs`
