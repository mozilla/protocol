Local navigation for a subset of pages or section of a website, intended to appear in a sidebar adjacent to the main content. It can accommodate multiple categories/sub-sections in a two-level hierarchy with titles corresponding to the top level page of each sub-section.

The menu summary reflects the current page, shown when the menu is collapsed in small viewports. The menu label should be the title of the site section.

- Indicate the current page with the `mzp-is-current` class.
