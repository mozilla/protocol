      label: E-mail address
      type: email
      id: email
  - name: Placeholder
    notes: |
      Field placeholders should show an example of the expected input, such as suggested search terms or a demonstration of a correctly formatted email address.

      ### No-nos
      - Don't use the `placeholder` attribute as a substitute for a `<label>`. It's a misuse of the attribute and leaves you with an inaccessible, unlabeled field.
