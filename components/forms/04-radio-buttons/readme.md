Radio buttons represent a set of options where only one may be selected.

[See the Choice component](choices) for custom styled radio buttons.

### Tips
  - Wrap the `<label>` element around both the control and its text label. This offers a bigger target for clicking.
  - Use the `mzp-u-inline` class to override the base block-level label styling.
