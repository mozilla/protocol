Checkboxes represent a set of options where multiple selections are allowed.

[See the Choices component](choices) for custom styled checkboxes.

### Tips

- Wrap the `<label>` element around both the control and its text label. This
  offers a bigger target for clicking.
- Use the `mzp-u-inline` class to override the base block-level label styling.
- Use a single checkbox for a binary choice (such as a yes or no question) rather
  than two radio buttons, especially if the field isn’t required. A checked radio
  button can’t be unchecked, whereas a single checkbox behaves as a switch to let
  a user toggle between the two states (you can uncheck a checked checkbox).
