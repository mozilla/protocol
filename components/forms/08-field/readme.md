The Field component is a wrapper around a field-label and field-control for more customized form styling. Though `<label>` and `<input>` elements get some default styling without these classes applied, wrapping them in a Field and adding the `mzp-c-field-label` and `mzp-c-field-control` classes will ensure the right spacing, especially when using other layout options.

### Tips
- The field wrapper can also contain an optional field-info component for added notes or instructions.
- The Field layout features are most useful in larger forms. They may not be needed for a small or simple form, like a single search box or a login form.
- Add the class `mzp-l-stretch` for full-width fields (preferably in a narrow form).
