A note to provide added context or instructions to supplement the field label.
It should be inside the `<label>` element, after the label text.

Inputs that are required to submit the form should carry both the `required`
and `aria-required` attributes along with a readable field note.

If a parent element has the class `mzp-is-error` the field note will be
highlighted.
