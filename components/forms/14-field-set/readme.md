A Field Set is a container for a group of thematically related Field components.
Field Sets will often use the `<fieldset>` element but could be some other element
(`<div>`, `<section>`, etc) despite the name. Use the most semantically appropriate
element for your situation.

### Tips

- If you use a `<fieldset>` element you should use `<legend>` for a title rather
  than a regular heading like `<h3>`.
