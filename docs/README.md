# Getting Started

Protocol is built on the [Node.js][node] platform and published to [NPM][npm], so be sure to have both installed before proceeding.

## Installation

To use Protocol in your website you can install the core package directly from NPM:

```
npm install @mozilla-protocol/core --save
```

Alternatively, you can also [download the latest release][releases] from GitHub.

## Usage

Once installed, the relevant CSS and JS files will be available in your project under `./mode_modules/@mozilla-protocol/core/`

The core CSS is bundled as `protocol.css`. This contains styling for things such as basic elements and typography. Component and layout CSS is bundled as `protocol-extra.scss` for convenience.

**Note**: The original source (scss) files are also included in the published package. You may want to consider compiling your own CSS to include only what you need for each page of your website, in order to further optimize for performance.

## Building from source

To build Protocol from source including the documentatiion site, you can clone the repo from GitHub:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mozilla/protocol.git
$ cd protocol
$ npm start
```

Running `npm start` will install dependencies, build your toolkit, and start the development server at <http://localhost:3000>.

## Tasks

The build sequence consists of a small set of [Gulp][gulp] tasks. While you'll probably only need `gulp` and `gulp --dev` most of the time, the other tasks can be called independently to process only a subset of your source files:

| Task           | Description
| ---            | ---
| `gulp`         | Build everything and start the development server.
| `gulp --dev`   | Do everything `gulp` does, but with file watching.
| `gulp clean`   | Empty the destination directory.
| `gulp copy`    | Copy static assets into the destination directory.
| `gulp css`     | Process CSS for the toolkit and Drizzle UI.
| `gulp js`      | Process JavaScript for the toolkit and Drizzle UI.
| `gulp drizzle` | Compile all data, pages, and patterns into HTML files.
| `gulp serve`   | Start the development server.
| `gulp watch`   | Run tasks automatically when file changes occur.


# Project Structure

New Drizzle projects contain some boilerplate files to help you get started. The default directory structure looks something like this:

```
my-drizzle-toolkit
├── dist
├── src
│   ├── assets
│   ├── data
│   ├── pages
│   ├── patterns
│   ├── static
│   └── templates
├── browserslist
├── config.js
└── gulpfile.js
```

| File | Description
| ---  | ---
| **dist** | Where toolkit builds are output
| **src/assets/toolkit** | Where toolkit CSS and JavaScript files live
| **src/data** | Where shared [template data](#data) files live
| **src/pages** | Where [Page](#pages) content and templates live
| **src/patterns** | Where [Pattern](#pages) templates live
| **src/static** | Where generic root assets live
| **src/templates** | Where [Page Layout](#layouts) and Drizzle UI templates live
| **browserslist** | The [Browserslist][browserslist] configuration for [Autoprefixer][autoprefixer]
| **config.js** | The [Gulp task](#tasks) configuration module
| **gulpfile.js** | The [Gulp task](#tasks) initialization script

## Patterns

A Pattern is a grouping of markup templates representing a distinct interface element. They are intended to be the most substantial and relevant part of your toolkit content.

The default project structure shows how you might classify patterns as **components** and **elements**:

```
src/patterns
├── components
└── elements
```

But you can use any naming convention that makes sense for your project:

```
src/patterns
├── atoms
├── molecules
└── organisms
```

### Collections

A Pattern _Collection_ is any folder within **src/patterns** that is the parent to one or more template files. The files can be named anything with a **.hbs** or **.html** extension, and will be concatenated into a single file during the build process.

Example input:

```
src/patterns/components
├── button
│   ├── base.hbs
│   └── primary.hbs
└── grid
    ├── default.hbs
    └── responsive.hbs
```

Example output:

```
dist/patterns/components
├── button.html
└── grid.html
```

### Variations

It's common for patterns to consist of multiple variations of the same general piece of markup. For example, the pattern collection for a button component could be structured as:

```
src/patterns/components/button
├── base.hbs
└── primary.hbs
```

These pattern variations are accessible from other templates as partials:

```hbs
{{> patterns.components.button.base}}
```

And for more complex cases, the **{{#extend}}** and **{{#embed}}** helpers can be used:

```hbs
{{#embed "patterns.components.button.base"}}
  ...
{{/embed}}
```

_Refer to the [Recipes](#recipes) section for examples of extending and embedding patterns._


## Pages

Pages can be used to present [Patterns](#patterns), or to supplement them with examples or additional documentation. They can be authored as [Markdown][marked], [Handlebars][handlebars], or standard HTML.

Example input:

```
src/pages
├── demos
│   ├── example.hbs
│   └── index.hbs
├── docs
│   ├── example.md
│   └── index.hbs
├── colors.hbs
└── index.hbs
```

Example output:

```
dist
├── demos
│   ├── example.html
│   └── index.html
├── docs
│   ├── example.html
│   └── index.html
├── colors.html
└── index.html
```

By default, Pages will include the surrounding Drizzle UI elements in their layout:

To use a different [layout template](#layouts), you can assign one in the Page [front-matter](#front-matter):

```yaml
title: Demo Page
layout: blank
```

_Refer to the [Layouts](#layouts) section for more information on the default layout templates._

## Data

To share common data across all [Page](#pages) and [Pattern](#patterns) templates, you can define data files in JSON or YAML format.

Some default files are included:

```
src/data
├── articles.yaml
├── colors.yaml
├── project.yaml
├── radfaces.json
└── specimens.yaml
```

Accessing values from these files can be done with the `{{data}}` template helper. For example:

```yaml
# src/data/team.yaml
- name: Pete
  photo: pete.jpg
- name: Paul
  photo: paul.jpg
- name: Mary
  photo: mary.jpg
```

```hbs
{{! src/pages/team.hbs !}}
{{#each (data "team")}}
  <img src="{{photo}}" alt="{{name}}">
{{/each}}
```

Results in:

```html
<!-- dist/team.html -->
<img src="pete.jpg" alt="Pete">
<img src="paul.jpg" alt="Paul">
<img src="mary.jpg" alt="Mary">
```

## Front-matter

[Patterns](#patterns) and [Pages](#pages) can leverage [YAML front-matter][front-matter] for local template data:

```
---
name: Basic Button
notes: This is _just_ a **basic** button.
---

<button class="Button">
  {{name}}
</button>
```

These values can be accessed directly within their own template (e.g. `{{name}}`). From outside templates, the values can be accessed via the `data` property:

```hbs
{{#with (page "colors")}}
  {{data.title}}
{{/with}}
```

Front-matter can also be applied to [Pattern Collections](#collections) by using a **collection.yaml** file at the root of the directory:

```
src/patterns/components/button
├── collection.yaml
├── base.hbs
└── primary.hbs
```

### Special Properties

While any arbitrary data can be added and referenced, there are some special property definitions that affect how things are displayed:

| Property       | Type    | Description
| ---            | ---     | ---
| **name**       | string  | Override the default name for Patterns and Collections. Example:&nbsp;`name: My Page`
| **order**      | number |  Override the default sort position for Patterns and Collections. Example:&nbsp;`order: 1`
| **hidden**     | boolean | Hide a Pattern variation from listings.
| **notes**      | string  | Annotate details about a Pattern variation with [Markdown][marked] formatting.
| **links**      | object  | Provide a menu of additional documentation links for a Pattern.
| **sourceless** | boolean | Prevent the HTML source of a Pattern from being displayed.
| **layout**     | string  | Associate a [Layout](#layouts) template to be used for wrapping Page content. Example:&nbsp;`layout: blank`

## Templates

Templates in the **src/templates** directory are intended for the surrounding Drizzle UI.

```
src/templates
├── drizzle
├── blank.hbs
├── collection.hbs
└── default.hbs
```

The templates in this directory differ from [Patterns](#patterns) and [Pages](#pages) in a few ways:

- They are for _presenting_ content (opposed to _being_ content).
- They do not utilize [front-matter][front-matter] data.
- They cannot be iterated over in any way.

### Layouts

Files at the top-level of the templates directory are assumed to be layout templates for [Pages](#pages):

| Layout             | Description
| ---                | ---
| **default.hbs**    | This is for standard pages that do require the presence of the Drizzle UI. [Example][demo-default]
| **blank.hbs**      | This is used for special standalone pages that don't require the presence of the Drizzle UI. [Example][demo-blank]
| **collection.hbs** | This is used for concatenating Pattern collections  into a single page. [Example][demo-collection]

### Partials

Files deeper than the top-level of the templates directory are intended to be used as partials for the Drizzle UI:

```
src/templates/drizzle
├── item.hbs
├── labelheader.hbs
├── logo.hbs
├── nav.hbs
├── page-item.hbs
└── swatch.hbs
```

## Helpers

A handful of helpers are included by default to assist with looking up and listing [Data](#data), [Pages](#pages), and [Patterns](#patterns).

**{{data}}** provides access to [Data](#data):

```hbs
{{#with (data "articles/3")}}
  {{title}} by {{author}}
{{/with}}
```

**{{pages}}** provides access to [Page](#pages) listings:

```hbs
<ul>
  {{#each (pages "portfolio" sortby="date")}}
    <li>
      <a href="{{url}}">{{data.title}}</a>
    </li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>
```

**{{collections}}** provides access to [Pattern collection](#patterncollections) listings:

```hbs
<ul>
  {{#each (collections "components" sortby="order")}}
    <li>
      <a href="{{url}}">{{name}}</a>
    </li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>
```

**{{#extend}}**, **{{#embed}}**, **{{#block}}** and **{{#content}}**:

The [handlebars-layouts][handlebars-layouts] helper suite is included to provide extensible "layout" behavior to all templates:

```hbs
{{! src/templates/foo.hbs }}
<html>
  <body>
    {{#block "main"}}
      Default content
    {{/block}}
  </body>
</html>
```

```hbs
{{#embed "foo"}}
  {{#content "main"}}
    Final content
  {{/content}}
{{/embed}}
```

```html
<html>
  <body>
    Final content
  </body>
</html>
```

Pattern templates can also benefit from these helpers:

```hbs
{{! src/patterns/components/button/base.hbs }}
<button class="Button {{class}}">
  {{#block "content"}}
    Base Button
  {{/block}}
</button>
```

```hbs
{{! src/patterns/components/button/primary.hbs }}
{{#embed "components.button.base" class="Button--primary"}}
  {{#content "content"}}
    Primary Button
  {{/content}}
{{/embed}}
```

```html
<button class="Button Button--primary">
  Primary Button
</button>
```

# Publishing

Protocol is published to NPM under the `@mozilla-protocol/core` namespace/package name. To publish a release to NPM, use the following steps:

1. Update the `version` number in `./src/assets/package/package.json` (use [Semantic Versioning][semver] to determine what the new version number should be).
2. Make sure the version number is commited to `master` in Git.
3. Tag a new release. You can do this either using [Git tag][git-tag], or directly on the [GitHub website][releases].
4. Run `gulp build` to create the NPM package. The package contents will be located in `./dist/assets/protocol/`.
5. Publish to NPM using `npm publish ./dist/assets/protocol/`.
