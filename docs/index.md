Protocol is a design system for Mozilla and Firefox websites. It establishes a common design language, provides reusable coded components, and outlines high level guidelines for content and accessibility.

Protocol is still an evolving project. Currently it’s used primarily by the Mozilla Marketing Websites team as the front-end for [www.mozilla.org](https://www.mozilla.org). The long term goal is to provide a robust, unified design system that anyone at Mozilla can use to build an on-brand website.

If you’re interested in using Protocol on your project, let us know and we can help you. You can find us in #protocol-design-system on Mozilla’s Slack (for Mozillians) or in #protocol-design-system on [Matrix](https://chat.mozilla.org) (open to the public). Also feel free to [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/protocol/issues).
