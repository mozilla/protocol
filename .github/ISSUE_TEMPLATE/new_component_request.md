Please use this template to request a new component.
If you're not sure whether a component already exists,
go ahead and file the issue here, and the team will triage appropriately.

Fill in as many sections as possible below.

### Please describe the use case(s) for this component

What does the component do? In what contexts is it used. Be as specific as possible.

### Please provide any designs or previous implementations of the proposed component

Add screenshots, mockups, code prototypes, etc. in this section.

## Please describe what this component does in the following conditions

* When set in front of a dark background
* When set in front of a light background
* When viewed in a mobile/responsive viewport

### Please provide examples of this type of component in use in non-Mozilla web properties

Add screenshots and links to web properties that use a similar component.
(We ask for this because we want to make sure we are following industry conventions while building components)

### Is the development of this component a blocking dependency for other work? Please explain if so

Generally speaking component definition should happen after a singleton instance has been developed,
or if the Protocol team has come to a consensus on need.
